Conceptually this project began as a desire to creatively interpret quantum field theory by showing it as a series of energy fields that interfere constructively / destructively under observation, yielding the colorful flows seen in the artwork. As the project progressed, an ethereal quality emerged that reminded me of experiences I have had while practicing meditation. While I am not spiritual I do feel an energetic connection to the world in these moments and was compelled to share what I experienced in this collection.
