Conceptually this project began as a desire to creatively interpret quantum field theory by showing it as a series of energy fields that interfere constructively / destructively under observation, yielding the colorful flows seen in the artwork. As the project progressed, an ethereal quality emerged that reminded me of experiences I have had while practicing meditation. While I am not spiritual I do feel an energetic connection to the world in these moments and was compelled to share what I experienced in this collection.

There are many ways one can practice meditation; using audio as an aid is a popular method. Soothing music, rustling sounds of nature, chimes of singing bowls, or low octave chants are among many of the popular auditory aids. Elements common to all include a mix of constant tones, pleasing chords, overlapping octaves and subtle variations over time. I used these elements to shape the synthesized audio frequencies in the omnipresent drone as it reacts to the slowly shifting light and dark areas within the visual art.

While my primary objective was to create an audio-visual experience someone can become lost in, I also wanted to ensure the first static frame would maintain this sense of motion and be suitable for a high quality print that could hang on the wall.
