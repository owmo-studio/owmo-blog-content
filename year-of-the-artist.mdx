Over the last few years, I have been developing my creative and technical skills via the work that I have released to the blockchain. While I have always been creative minded, dabbling here and there outside of my day job, only recently have I been afforded the great luxury of being able to explore in full every day. I started out this period of my life thinking it would likely be a flash in the pan, but now I see the potential to move it into a longer term pursuit.

I've always been an active goal-setter who recorded concrete objectives for the next year and would spend time reflecting on how well I achieved them. In recent years, I discovered **The Theme System** and have been using it every year. In this system, one defines a high level guide that you can reference throughout the year to achieve meaningful change in your life's direction, rather than a set of yes/no outcomes. You can read more about it on their website here:

I have chosen _Year of the Artist_ as my guiding principle for 2024. What this means to me is taking reforming all of my work into a professional practice. It also means doing some reflection on what motivates me as an artist. What techniques do I want to focus on? What are the bigger picture achievements I'd like to pursue? How could I produce artwork that reaches more collectors, both online and in real life?

## Ideal Outcomes

An over-arching guiding principle is great, but it's still helpful to have some tangible outcomes to work on. Here's what I've been doing thus far:

-   Defining my artistic personal and goals ✓
-   Incorporating my practice as OWMO Studio LTD ✓
-   Build a new website with professional artist materials ✓
-   Prepare a media strategy suitable for deep focus ✓

Now that I've laid the foundation of a professional practice, I'm looking forward to bringing my attention back to my artwork and focussing on these ideal outcomes:

-   Be able to mint and browse all of my on-chain artworks on my website
-   Release a generative collection via custom contract entirely on my own
-   Produce high quality prints and offer them for sale via an online store
-   Exhibit at Eastside Culture Crawl and Vancouver International Art Show
-   Reduce time using social media, focus on blog and newsletter readership

As well, check out my **WIP** (work in progress) section where I share some insights into the work that I'm actively prototyping or considering developing. The next year and beyond is looking bright, I just need to get out there and get some sun!
